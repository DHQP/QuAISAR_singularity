# Description: A script that takes a sample and compares it to a busco database to discover number of similar genes (% conserved proteins) from prokka output
#
# Usage ./do_busco.sh sample_name DB(to search against) run_ID
#
# Output location: default_config.sh_output_location/run_ID/sample_name/BUSCO/
#
# Modules required: busco/3.0.1, Python3/3.5.4 (whatever version used to install it, must have pipebricks)
#
# v1.0.1 (10/10/2019)
